To create a "Dominos Sales Analysis" project using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, follow these key steps:

### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation (Excel/SQL)**  
First, gather raw sales data from Dominos, including customer orders, delivery times, product categories, sales by region, and other relevant metrics like discounts and customer feedback. You can import this data into SQL tables or manage it within Excel. Clean and structure the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.

### 2. **Data Modeling (SQL)**  
Using SQL, create a robust data model by joining multiple tables such as order details, customer demographics, and regional sales. This will allow you to perform complex queries, like filtering sales by product type, calculating total sales per region, and analyzing customer trends. You can also optimize performance by creating views or stored procedures for recurring queries.

### 3. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**  
Import the cleaned and modeled data into Power BI. Build an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics such as total sales, sales trends, product performance, customer segmentation, and regional comparisons. Use a mix of charts—like bar graphs, line charts, and pie charts—to present insights effectively. Integrate slicers for dynamic filtering by date, region, or product category.

### 4. **Dashboard Insights and KPIs**  
Highlight critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like average order value, total revenue, top-selling products, and regional growth. Ensure the dashboard is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing stakeholders to derive actionable insights on sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

This approach will deliver a comprehensive analysis of Dominos' sales, helping in strategic decision-making.
